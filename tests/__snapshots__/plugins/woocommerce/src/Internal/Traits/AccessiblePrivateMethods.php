/**
 * DON'T USE THIS TRAIT. It will be removed in WooCommerce 10.5.
 * Instead, make the hook target methods public and mark them with an @internal annotation.
 *
 * This trait allows making private methods of a class accessible from outside.
 * This is useful to define hook handlers with the [$this, 'method'] or [__CLASS__, 'method'] syntax
 * without having to make the method public (and thus having to keep it forever for backwards compatibility).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * class Foobar {
 *   use AccessiblePrivateMethods;
 *
 *   public function __construct() {
 *     self::add_action('some_action', [$this, 'handle_some_action']);
 *   }
 *
 *   public static function init() {
 *     self::add_filter('some_filter', [__CLASS__, 'handle_some_filter']);
 *   }
 *
 *   private function handle_some_action() {
 *   }
 *
 *   private static function handle_some_filter() {
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * For this to work the callback must be an array and the first element of the array must be either '$this', '__CLASS__',
 * or another instance of the same class; otherwise the method won't be marked as accessible
 * (but the corresponding WordPress 'add_action' and 'add_filter' functions will still be called).
 *
 * No special procedure is needed to remove hooks set up with these methods, the regular 'remove_action'
 * and 'remove_filter' functions provided by WordPress can be used as usual.
 *
 * @deprecated 9.6.0 Make the hook target methods public and mark them with an @internal annotation. This trait will be removed in WooCommerce 10.5.
