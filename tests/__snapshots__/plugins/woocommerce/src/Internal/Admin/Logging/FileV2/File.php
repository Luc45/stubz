     * Parse a path to a log file to determine if it uses the standard filename structure and various properties.

     * This makes assumptions about the structure of the log file's name. Using `-` to separate the name into segments,
     *  if there are at least 5 segments, it assumes that the last segment is the hash, and the three segments before
     *  that make up the date when the file was created in YYYY-MM-DD format. Any segments left after that are the
     *  "source" that generated the log entries. If the filename doesn't have enough segments, it falls back to the
     *  source and the hash both being the entire filename, and using the inode change time as the creation date.
