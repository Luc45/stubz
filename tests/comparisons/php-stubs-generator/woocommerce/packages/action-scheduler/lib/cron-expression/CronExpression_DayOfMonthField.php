/**
 * Day of month field.  Allows: * , / - ? L W
 *
 * 'L' stands for "last" and specifies the last day of the month.
 *
 * The 'W' character is used to specify the weekday (Monday-Friday) nearest the
 * given day. As an example, if you were to specify "15W" as the value for the
 * day-of-month field, the meaning is: "the nearest weekday to the 15th of the
 * month". So if the 15th is a Saturday, the trigger will fire on Friday the
 * 14th. If the 15th is a Sunday, the trigger will fire on Monday the 16th. If
 * the 15th is a Tuesday, then it will fire on Tuesday the 15th. However if you
 * specify "1W" as the value for day-of-month, and the 1st is a Saturday, the
 * trigger will fire on Monday the 3rd, as it will not 'jump' over the boundary
 * of a month's days. The 'W' character can only be specified when the
 * day-of-month is a single day, not a range or list of days.
